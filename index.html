  	My final project is called "sound of the picture". Users can press the button to start their front camera and take a picture, then the program will play sounds that applies different atmosphere. The atmosphere is going to be decided by the overall color tone of the photo, which will be analyzed by program. The kinds of sound are: relaxing (main color blue), exciting (main color red), peaceful(main color green), down(main color black or gray). Then, users can choose to save the result or retake the pictures by pressing the buttons.

  	My motivation for making this interactive story is to study the atmosphere that colors imply and to represent them by sounds. I want audience to think about the impression that colors can give us, or just take a picture and analyze it for fun.
